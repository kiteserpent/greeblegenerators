Static Generator

Right-click it with wool to make 5 RF. Has no internal storage. Connects to the sides and bottom.


Spark Chamber

Catches cosmic particles to produce random bursts of 5,000 RF. Must be in complete darkness to work.


Greeble Generator

To build this, you first need to catch an invisible greeble. Craft a Greeble Trap, place it on grassy dirt, move away and wait. Eventually, if no players are within 24m, it will catch a greeble. This Caged Greeble can be used to craft the generator.

Once you've placed the generator, you can supply the greeble inside with food to generate energy. Greebles care about both hunger and saturation, and they produce RF proportional to whichever of their stats is LOWER, up to a maximum of 50 RF/t if you get both status bars to 100%. You'll have to find a mix of at least two different foods -- an imbalanced diet eventually produces barely any RF.

But greebles are fussy eaters! They won't eat food that's too well-balanced. They also won't eat food that has a 0 for either stat or that causes conditions.


Deep Kelp Generator

This higher-tier generator only functions if it is under at least 20 blocks of water AND over a magma-induced bubble column. It burns dried kelp or dried kelp blocks.

The default energy rate is 25 RF/t, but you can apply a Sulfurous Infusion to the magma to quadruple the generator's output. Sulfurous Infusions should be craftable from any properly-tagged sulfur dust or cluster from other mods. As a fallback, it can be crafted from gunpowder as well. To apply it, just right-click it onto the magma block, or use a Dispenser. The infusion will wear off after some random amount of time, however, and you'll need another application to maintain full power.

Note 1: This generator may be a little slow to detect changes in depth or bubble status. Those checks are expensive so it doesn't do them often.

Note 2: Swimming in sulfurous bubble columns doesn't replenish your oxygen. This is technically a bug but it makes sense so I'm leaving it that way. Hah.
